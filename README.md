Leveraging Active Learning with uncertainty quantification by Investigation of Molpal Exploration
</h1>

## Overview 

Molpal (Molecular Pool-based Active Learning) is a software created by the coleygroup for the accelerated discovery of compounds in high-throughput virtual screening environments.
Using  a modified version of Molpal, the objective is to find a good way to leverage active learning and uncertainty quantification to minimize the number of total molecules acquired by the algorithm, while recovering a good percentage of the top X%  of the candidates depending on the dataset.

## Installation

1. Clone the modified version of Molpal from this repository:

"""
git clone https://github.com/Nohalyan/molpal
"""

2. Install the necessary dependencies. YOu can use the environment.yml
